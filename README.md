# Lustrousness
## All the content you could need... and of course the content you don't need

Lustrousness is a fabric server side mod that adds tons of new content to the game and alters most of the vanilla game to make it more challenging.

It uses Polymer to achieve the server side quality, and uses resource packs to display custom textures.
